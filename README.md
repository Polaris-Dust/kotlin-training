# [Antaes](https://www.antaes.ch/en/), Kotlin overview
Kotlin is an object-oriented and functional programming language created by **JetBrains**.
It is the (other) official language for Android development.

## Key features
* Interoperability with JVM
* Cross-platform
* Statically typed with type inference
* Object-oriented
* Functional
* Target JVM or JS
* One of the fastest growing language
* Open-source
* Fully supported by IntelliJ with code conversion from/to Java
* Already a lot of dedicated tools, frameworks

## Code sample
```Kotlin
fun main() = println("Hello")
```

## Some nice stuff
* Null safe by default
* Extension function
* Complex switch cases
* `if`...`else` and `try`...`catch` (and a lot more) are instructions with a return value, making the java ternary operator obsolete.
* Ranges (`1..10` for instance)
* Data classes
* Object (singleton)
* Companion object
* Delegated properties
* Default value for method parameters
* Named arguments
* `let` keyword allowing object initialization and configuration in a single block
* Destructuring declaration
